**Design of an Open-Source Toolbox for Electric Machine Optimization**

There are many commercial electric machine design software, but there are only a few open-source and non-profit software in this area. The aim of the project is to combine all these small codes and software into a single toolbox that can be used freely by researchers around the world.

The project is being developed under [STAR Projects](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/), [Electrical-Electronics Engineering](http://eee2.metu.edu.tr/), [METU](http://www.metu.edu.tr/).
